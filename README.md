===================== 

Welcome to the Corner Grocer Tracker! This C++ program reads your daily shopping log and tells you exactly how many times each produce item was purchased. It even makes a backup file so your counts are safe.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Need

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (for example, `g++` or Visual C++ Build Tools).
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code or another text editor.
- The input file: `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt` (one item per line).

---

## Quick Start

1. **Place your files**  
   - `main.cpp` (the source code)  
   - `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt` (your sample data)  
   both in the same folder.

2. **Open a terminal** in that folder.

3. **Compile** by running:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -o tracker main.cpp
